        Luke? Luke? Luke? <span>jorge</span> Have you seen Luke this morning? He
        said he had some things to do before he started today,
        so he left early. Uh? Did he take those two new droids
        with him? I think so. <a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/">la nacion</a> Well, he'd better have those units
        in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be
        hell to pay! Wait, there's something dead ahead on the
        scanner. It looks like our droid...hit the accelerator.
